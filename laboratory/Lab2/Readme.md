# Laboratory 2: Forward Kinematics

Welcome to the second laboratory of the semester. 

## Goals
The goals of the laboratory are
1. to get a better grasp of homogeneous transforms and how we can use them with our robots
2. learn how to build complex rigid transforms from simple building blocks
3. implement your first forward kinematics algorithm
4. use the forward kinematics algorithm to analyze the movements of the robot's foot


## Pre-requisites
In order to do the laboratory you will need to have installed on your machine:
* Python 3
* numpy, matplotlib 
* pybullet

## Step 1: Make sure to understand the introductory slides
 [Introduction to forward kinematics](intro_to_forward_kinematics.pdf)

## Step 2: Implement transforms to get the end position of the foot
Complete the [Forward Kinematics notebook](Forward_Kinematics.ipynb)
