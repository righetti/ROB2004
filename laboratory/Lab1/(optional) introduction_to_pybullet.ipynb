    "# Introduction to PyBullet (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) is a \"rigid body dynamics\" simulator, it means that it can simulate any articulated, rigid, robot. For example our NYU finger but also more complex robots, such as a humanoid, a quadruped or a hand. It can also simulate other objects and several robots at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, every simulator functions as follows:\n",
    "* First a description of the objects and robots to simulate are given, including their dynamic properties (masses, center of mass), their \"boundaries\" (to detect collisions between objects) and graphic files to visualize the robot. The visualization is often different than what is simulated (i.e. we often simplify the geometry of the robot, e.g. using cylinders, for the simulation but display all the details in the visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each instant of time, the simulator keeps track of all the collisions between all the objects, to know where to compute contact forces. Typically the collisions are simplified to make the simulation fast enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The simulator then computes all the forces exerted on all the objects and robots (e.g. gravity, contact between objects, etc) and uses Netwon's law of motion to compute the next position and velocity of all the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can then decide to apply forces/torques on certain joints, like a motor would do and read all the available information from the simulator to emulate real sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a user, we then need to write a \"controller\" that decides what to do at each simulation step.\n"
