    "# Closing the loop with a PD controller\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the previous notebook how to do a simple control loop that read sensors and applied torque commands. However, we did not use the sensor measurements to compute the torque commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to do our first closed-loop controller. We will design a simple Proportional-Derivative (PD) position controller. The goal of the controller is to compute a command that will move the joints of the robot to a desired position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we want the first joint, with measurement position $\\theta$, to move to the desired position $\\theta_{des}$. The idea is to apply a command proportional to the error between the measured and desired position (the P in PD controller). The  error is\n",
    "$$\\textrm{error} = (\\theta_{des} - \\theta)$$  and\n",
    "the controller will be $\\tau = P \\cdot \\textrm{error} = P (\\theta_{des} - \\theta)$ where $P$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using only a term proportional to the position, the controller will tend to create oscillations and get easily unstable (you can try!). It is then a good idea to add a term proportional to the time derivative of the error (the D term). \n",
    "The time derivative of the error is\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\textrm{error} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta_{des} - \\theta) =  \\dot{\\theta}_{des} - \\dot{\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So a PD controller takes the general form\n",
    "$\\tau = P (\\theta_{des} - \\theta) + D (\\dot{\\theta}_{des} - \\dot{\\theta})$\n",
    "where $P$ and $D$ are positive numbers called the **PD gains**\n",
    "Intuitively it applies a command that tries to follow at the same time a desired position and a desired velocity (which dampens fast oscillations).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to be in a static position, $\\dot{\\theta}_{des}$ will be 0, but if we want to follow a trajectory $\\theta_{des}(t)$ which varies over time, the derivative $\\dot{\\theta}_{des}(t)$ will not be 0 anymore."
