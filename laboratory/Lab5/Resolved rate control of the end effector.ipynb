You will need to reuse the kinematics functions written in the previous laboratories.\n",

Compare the computed velocities with the velocities you get by numerically differentiating the end-effector positions (i.e. by computing $v[t] = \\frac{x[t] - x[t-1]}{\\Delta t}$). \n",

    "Here you will ignore the angular velocity and only consider the linear velocity of the end-effector. If we only look at the linear velocity of point O (i.e. the velocity of the end-effector with respect to frame O), we can decompose the Jacobian into two part (the top 3 rows are associated to the angular velocity of the end-effector and the bottom 3 are associated to the linear velocity): $$J_O(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\begin{bmatrix} J_{O\\omega} \\\\ J_{Ov} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

We will work in \"end-effector space\".\n",

    "Assume we have a reference end-effector trajectory (e.g. coming from our trajectory generator that create smooth trajectories from a starting point to a desired goal with 0 velocities and accelerations at the beginning and end of the trajectories). At each instant of time, we then get $x_{ref}$ and $\\dot{x}_{ref}$, the desired position and velocity of the end-effector.
