    "# Interpolation for trajectory generation\n",
    "In the last laboratory, we generated desired joint positions from an initial position $\\theta_{init}$ at time $t=t_{init}$ to a goal position $\\theta_{goal}$ at time $t=t_{end}$ to reach a desired goal with the end-effector.\n",

    "Indeed, it is generally not a good idea to just send the desired goal joint positions to the PD controller because if they are too far from the actual positions, the error will be large and a large torque will be applied on each motor. This will likely create a very jerky movement which could damage the robot, its motors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, at every control cycle, it is desirable to compute a desired position to send to the PD controller which is \"in-between\" the initial and goal position. One straightforward manner to do this is to interpolate between the initial and goal position. For example, we could set\n",
