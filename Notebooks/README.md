This folder contains Notebooks illustrating some of the concepts discussed in the class.

* [Rotations in 2D.ipynb](Rotations%20in%202D.ipynb) illustrate basic concepts of rotations with 2D examples
* [body vs spatial transformations.ipynb](body%20vs%20spatial%20transformations.ipynb) illustrates the difference between a transformation with respect to the body frame and one with respect to the spatial frame
* [Euler angles.ipynb](Euler%20angles.ipynb) illustrates Euler angles and singularity issues
* [Forward_Kinematics_examples.ipynb](Forward_Kinematics_examples.ipynb) provides code for the forward kinematics examples seen in class (ABB and Kuka robots)
* [Introduction to Pinocchio](Introduction%20to%20Pinocchio.ipynb) provides a quick introduction to the robot modeling software [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio). More examples and tutorials can be found on the Pinocchio website.
* [Inverse geometry of the Kuka Robot](Inverse%20Geometry%20for%20the%20Kuka%20robot.ipynb) provides examples of inverse geometry using our custom written forward kinematics and SciPy minimize function.
* [Inverse geometry of the Talos Humanoid Robot](Inverse%20Geometry%20for%20the%20Talos%20Humanoids%20robot.ipynb) provides examples of inverse geometry using Pinocchio's forward kinematics and SciPy minimize function.
* [Forward_Kinematics_exponential_formula.ipynb](Forward_Kinematics_exponential_formula.ipynb) provides code for the forward kinematics examples seen in class (ABB and Kuka robots) using the product of exponential formula
* [Inverse kinematics example - Kuka iiwa robot.ipynb](Inverse%20kinematics%20example%20-%20Kuka%20iiwa%20robot.ipynb) provides several examples of inverse kinematics for the Kuka iiwa robot
* [Inverse kinematics example - Talos humanoid robot.ipynb](Inverse%20kinematics%20example%20-%20Talos%20humanoid%20robot.ipynb) is an example of inverse kinematics with several tasks for a humanoid robot
