Using an impedance controller (Lab4 - use the ``getBodyJacobianOrientedLikeSpatialFrame`` function to get the Jacobian) and one trajectory generation method seen in Lab3 write a complete controller that solves the problem: move the top two cubes away, grasp the last cube and move it up by 10cm. In the report, describe in details the controller you designed (what it does, etc) and the results you obtained.\n",
