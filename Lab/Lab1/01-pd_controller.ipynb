    "# Closing the loop with a Proportional-Derivative controller\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the previous notebook how to do a simple control loop that read sensors and applied torque commands. However, we did not use the sensor measurements to compute the torque commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/control_loop.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we would like to do our first closed-loop controller. We will design a simple Proportional-Derivative (PD) position controller. The goal of the controller is to compute a command that will move the joints of the robot to a desired position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we want the first joint, with measurement position $\\theta$, to move to the desired position $\\theta_{des}$. The idea is to apply a command proportional to the error between the measured and desired position (the P in PD controller). The  error is\n",
    "$$\\textrm{error} = (\\theta_{des} - \\theta)$$  and\n",
    "the desired torque to apply to the join will be $\\tau = P \\cdot \\textrm{error} = P (\\theta_{des} - \\theta)$ where $P$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using only a term proportional to the position, the controller will tend to create oscillations and get easily unstable (you can try!). It is then a good idea to add a term proportional to the time derivative of the error (the D term), i.e. proportional to the velocity.\n",
    "The time derivative of the error is\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\textrm{error} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\theta_{des} - \\theta) =  \\dot{\\theta}_{des} - \\dot{\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So a PD controller takes the general form\n",
    "$\\tau = P (\\theta_{des} - \\theta) + D (\\dot{\\theta}_{des} - \\dot{\\theta})$\n",
    "where $P$ and $D$ are positive numbers called the **PD gains**\n",
    "Intuitively it applies a command that tries to follow at the same time a desired position and a desired velocity (which dampens fast oscillations).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to be in a static position, $\\dot{\\theta}_{des}$ will be 0, but if we want to follow a trajectory $\\theta_{des}(t)$ which varies over time, the derivative $\\dot{\\theta}_{des}(t)$ will not be 0 anymore."
